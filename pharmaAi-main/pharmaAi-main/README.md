# 💔 MediSecure — Because Some Families Don't Get a Second Chance

## The Story Behind This Project

Meet **Aanya**.

She was 34. A mother of two. Bright eyes, loud laugh, the kind of person who remembered everyone's birthday.

Her doctor prescribed codeine after a minor surgery. Standard stuff. Completely routine.

What the doctor didn't know — what *no one* knew — was that Aanya's DNA carried a silent mutation in a gene called **CYP2D6**. It made her a **Poor Metabolizer**. Her body couldn't process codeine the normal way. Instead of pain relief, her body converted it all — too fast, too much — into a lethal dose of morphine.

She never woke up.

**Her death was 100% preventable.**

A simple genetic test. A 5-minute check. That's all it would have taken.

We couldn't save Aanya. But we built **MediSecure** so that no one else has to lose someone they love to a prescription that should have been safe.

## 🧬 What is MediSecure?

**MediSecure** is an AI-powered pharmacogenomic risk prediction tool.

You upload a patient's genetic file (VCF format). You enter a drug name. We tell you — within seconds — whether that drug is **safe**, **dangerous**, or **deadly** for that specific person.

Simple. Fast. Life-saving.

> *100,000+ Americans die every year from adverse drug reactions. Most of them had no idea their genes put them at risk.*

## How It Works (In Plain English)

```
1. You upload a patient's genetic file  →  We read their DNA variants
2. You type a drug name                →  We check it against their genes
3. We use AI (Google Gemini)          →  To explain the risk in human language
4. You get a clear answer             →  Safe ✅  Adjust dose ⚠️  Avoid ❌
```

That's it. No medical degree required to understand the output.

## What You'll See

After analysis, MediSecure gives you:

**A clear risk label** — Safe, Caution, or Toxic/Contraindicated

**The science behind it** — which gene, which mutation, why it matters

**A plain-English explanation** — written by AI, readable by anyone

**Alternative drugs** — if the original drug is unsafe

**A link to official CPIC guidelines** — so doctors can verify everything

## 🧪 Test Files Included

We included 3 sample patient files so you can see PharmaGuard in action immediately:

| File | What it shows |
|------|---------------|
| `patient_high_risk.vcf` | A patient like Aanya — dangerous drug interaction |
| `patient_normal.vcf` | A patient with no genetic risks — safe to proceed |
| `patient_intermediate.vcf` | A patient who needs dose adjustments |

---

## 🏗 Tech Stack

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no bloat, just fast |
| Backend | Node.js + Express |
| AI Engine | LLM |
| Standards | CPIC Guidelines (the gold standard in pharmacogenomics) |
| Hosting | Render.com — free, fast, reliable |

## One Last Thing

Somewhere out there, there's another Aanya.

She's about to be handed a prescription. Her doctor means well. The pharmacy will fill it without question. And no one — no one — will think to check her genes.
